We tested these waters exactly two years ago, in 2013, and we realized we had immeasurable potential. That moment was a New Beginning, the commencement of a New Era, and we began devoting ourselves to making decisions that will continue to scale closer to our vision. We are a great organisation, one thatâ€™s ready to shine and flourish, a place that feels like home. We live in the future, and we continue to embrace every single moment as a new opportunity!",
