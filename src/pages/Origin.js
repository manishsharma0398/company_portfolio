        "Rolandos Enterprises Public Ltd was named after its founder, Rolandos Loizou. In 1983, the Cypriot entrepreneur established a small limited liability company named R.L. Photographic Ltd. His dedication and passion for color processing and photography soon made R.L. Photographic Ltd. one of the leading studios in local market.",
        "In 1985 Loizou invested in the cutting-edge Fujifilm Mini Lab which, at the time, revolutionized chemical processing and development for direct printing up to A3. While traditional labs required lead times of up to a week, this new technology could develop and print in just 23 minutes! ",
        "Loizou was always at the forefront of printing technology, as when he invested in two new Canon innovations: the first color copier system in the world that used toner technology and could print up to A3 media size, and the Canon Bubble-Jet printer, which was capable of printing 400 dpi (dots per inch) quality color digital prints of up to 60*80cm.",
        "By taking full advantage of these technological innovations, by 1986 Loizou had established the first high-tech color copy center factory in the local market, Colours by Rolandos Ltd. But Loizou had yet more aspirations: he wanted to satisfy the demand for larger outdoor graphics. By heavily investing in 3M Manufacturing Company, he was able to introduce the company’s unique innovations to the local market and provide wide format digital printing and signage graphics. With hard work, dedication and attention to detail, he soon became one of the major signage exporters to Africa, Greece, Israel, Romania and the United Arab Emirates. ",
        "In 1997 Loizou became the official representative of 3M Scotchprint technology (Match Component System), with exclusive rights for the local market and other nearby locations.",
        "In 1998 he invested in a company called Vutek (EFI) and acquired the first 5 meter digital super wide printer model, the Vutek 5300. Vutek was flourishing, with major clients such as B.A.T (British American Tobacco), Coca Cola, Pepsi and Rothmans International.",
        "In 2000 Loizou made investments in several advertising outdoor media companies and secured municipal agreements for outdoor advertising media and street furniture, including bus stops.",
        "It isn’t just printing and photography where Rolandos Loizou has been successful. In 1992 he established a successful collaboration with a dermatologist on a product called Bio-peeling. His wife, Yiola Loizou, was at the time a physiotherapist and beauty therapist with her own salon. Working together, the Loizou's acquired the product patent for the Bio-peeling product and established Neoderma.  ",
        "Today NEODERMA is an international brand with exports to more than 22 destinations throughout Asia, Central Europe and the Middle East. NEODERMA has a complete full range of about 200 unique formula patents for products for professional beauty therapists and for the consumer at home. The NEODERMA factory is today located in the center of Nicosia, the Capital with a high-end, technologically-advanced facility covering an area of approximately 8.000 square meters.",
        "Mr. Rolandos Loizou is currently the major shareholder of the company and President of the Board of Directors.",
        "In 2015, Mr. Andreas Loizou, son of the President, was appointed by the Board of Directors as new CEO & Executive Member of the Board of Directors at the R Group.",
        "The new CEO re-invented, rebranded, and re-engineered from scratch the label toward a luxury skincare product. ",
        'Mr. Andreas Loizou lives today in Amsterdam, the Netherlands where he re-established the new European headquarters (NEODERMA AMSTERDAM B.V.), in Amsterdam and Naarden "The Fortress." ',
        "In an interview held in Amsterdam, the CEO, Mr. Andreas Loizou, stated:",
        '"We have now entered a multi-venture journey, building-up new strategic partnerships with some of the fastest growing companies in the U.S., Scandinavia, Central, and Northern Europe, the Middle East, and Asia. This is the lift-off stage (global expansion plan 2018 – 2022)."',
